### API Fallback Logic:
The context now includes fallback to dummy data when API calls fail:

try {
  // Attempt API call
  const response = await postAPI.getPosts(params);
  // Use API data
} catch (apiError) {
  // Fallback to DUMMY_POSTS
  const dummyData = DUMMY_POSTS[channelKey];
  setPosts(dummyData);
}
```

This ensures the dashboard always works, even without backend connectivity.
